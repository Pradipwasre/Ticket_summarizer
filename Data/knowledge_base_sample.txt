# Xumo Streaming Device Connectivity Troubleshooting

## Common Connectivity Issues

### Stream Box Connection Problems

When a Xumo Stream Box fails to connect to the internet despite other devices working correctly, this typically indicates one of the following issues:

1. **WiFi Signal Interference**: The Stream Box may be located too far from the router or experiencing interference from walls, appliances, or other electronic devices.

2. **Hardware Defect**: In rare cases, the WiFi or Ethernet component in the Stream Box may be defective, especially if connections fail across multiple networks and connection methods.

3. **Software Bug**: Occasional software bugs in the Stream Box firmware can cause connectivity issues that require factory resets or firmware updates.

4. **Network Compatibility**: Some older routers or specific ISP configurations may have compatibility issues with Xumo Stream Box devices.

### Xumo TV App Connection Issues

Xumo TV smart television sets may experience different connectivity challenges:

1. **Firmware Updates**: Outdated firmware often causes connection instability or app freezing.

2. **Memory Management**: Extended viewing sessions can lead to memory leaks in some models, requiring a power cycle.

3. **DNS Configuration**: Some ISPs use DNS settings that can conflict with Xumo TV services.

## Troubleshooting Protocol

### Standard Connectivity Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Power Cycle**: Turn off the device, unplug from power for 60 seconds, then reconnect and restart.

2. **Router Reset**: Reset the home router/modem by unplugging for 60 seconds.

3. **WiFi Testing**: Test connection on alternative WiFi networks (mobile hotspot, neighbor's WiFi if available).

4. **Ethernet Testing**: For Stream Box, test using wired Ethernet connection if available.

5. **Factory Reset**: Perform factory reset as a last resort before escalation.

### Escalation Criteria

Escalate to Tier 2 support if:

1. All standard troubleshooting steps have been completed without resolution.
2. Multiple connection methods (WiFi, Ethernet, hotspot) have been attempted.
3. Device works properly in all aspects except internet connectivity.
4. Factory reset did not resolve the issue.

### Hardware Replacement Indicators

Consider hardware replacement when:

1. Device fails to connect across multiple networks and connection methods.
2. Factory reset does not resolve the issue.
3. Similar devices work properly in the same environment.
4. Diagnosis tools indicate hardware failure.

## Known Issues by Model

### Stream Box (2023-2024 Models)

Some units manufactured between November 2023 and February 2024 have a known issue with WiFi antenna connections that can become loose during shipping. This typically manifests as:

- Intermittent connectivity
- Inability to detect 5GHz networks
- Significantly reduced WiFi range compared to specifications
- Device shows connected status but cannot stream content

### Hisense Xumo TV (2024 Models)

A software update released in March 2024 resolved a widespread issue where Hisense Xumo TVs would freeze after extended streaming sessions. If customer has not updated firmware since March 2024, recommend immediate update.

## ISP-Specific Notes

### Spectrum

Some Spectrum customers with specific modem models (particularly the Wave2 RAC2V1S) have reported compatibility issues with Xumo Stream Box devices. Recommended solutions:

1. Request modem firmware update from Spectrum
2. Use Ethernet connection instead of WiFi when possible
3. Set router to use alternative DNS servers (such as Google DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4)

### Comcast/Xfinity

Xfinity xFi Advanced Security feature has occasionally blocked Xumo service connections. If customer uses Xfinity and experiences connection issues:

1. Temporarily disable Advanced Security to test
2. Add Xumo devices to allowed list in xFi settings
3. Consider setting up Xumo device on Guest Network
